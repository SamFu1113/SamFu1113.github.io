I am Sam, a graduate student in information engineering at National Central University in Taiwan, who graduated in 2022. I worked as a research assistant at National Central University Intelligent Systems Software Laboratory (ISSL) for 1 year. In my master's thesis, I verified the accuracy of a random forest (RF) model in predicting virtual machine (VM) power-on time.
I am currently looking for a position as a Systems Software Engineer.
